# Performance Tracker Dashboard

### Background
This dashboard is built from a 360-reviews dataset spanning over 3 two-week periods. Every two weeks, interns at Enterprise Hall were asked to complete a 360-reviews survey to rate their team members on a scale from 1-3 with 1 being "doesn't meet", 2 being "meets", and 3 being "exceeds." 
There are 5 measures that quantify performance and productivity: initiative, creativity, inquisitivity, respect, and teamwork.
